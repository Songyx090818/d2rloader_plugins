// Crossbow Charges
//
// Crossbow skills fire from a pool of bolts instead of sharing one cooldown,
// the skill buttons show the bolts left and a shadow that clocks down the next
// bolt, and every hit that comes from a crossbow skill (or from anything that
// hit triggers) deals a stat-driven bonus on its final damage.
//
// Everything below was read out of the D2RLoader 1.3.0 process image and
// D2RCore.dll, and every entry, call site and register used here is checked
// byte for byte at load. Nothing is installed when a check fails.
//
// D2RLoader 1.3 runs item event functions inside D2RCore.dll. For event
// function 20 D2RCore registers its own handler, which casts through the
// game's 5896E0 -> 589930 but never calls the game's table slot 20, so the
// slot hook up to 1.2.1 never ran and procs from crossbow hits were never
// tagged. 1.2.2 puts the same hook into D2RCore's handler table instead (entry
// 20 of the table RegisterWideSkillEffect hands its registrar, read when an
// event is registered). D2RCore's handlers take the game's arguments in the
// game's order; its forwarders pass rcx, rdx, r8 and r9 straight through, so
// the hook's owner is still r8.
//
// D2RLoader 1.3.1: the loader's thunk table moved up by D4h. The proc caster
// at 589C37 / 589C41 now calls GenerateUnitCastId through 3E2B64C and
// SetUnitCastId through 3E2B652 (3E2B578 / 3E2B57E in 1.3.0). Every other
// site checked here is unchanged.
//
// 1.3.0: the damage bonus reached only hits whose damage the engine
// recalculated inside SUNITDMG_ExecuteEvents (the missile flag on). Damage a
// skill function calculated up front and applied later (the stored melee
// record, PrepareAndQueueCombatRecord 44B600 -> ConsumeMeleeCombatRecord
// 44B2B0) and every other hit applied with the flag off never got it, and
// missile damage applied without the engine's owner stamp (the area callback
// 464610, the general applier 436E90) was judged by whatever the player cast
// last. The bonus now sits where every hit passes (section 6), and a hit is
// judged by the missile the engine is resolving when it is the attacker's own
// section 5).
//
// 1.3.2: the damage bonus never applied to anything, in any version. Every
// server-side part of it (skill-start tags, the hit bonus, proc tags, missile
// links) first checked that the unit is a server unit with 34F8D0, which reads
// bit 21 of unit+124h. That bit marks async client-only units; it is clear on
// the player on both sides, so every one of those parts skipped the player.
// Server units are the ones carrying 4000000h in unit+128h, set by the server
// unit allocator 4905A0 (which also stores the game at unit+D8h) and by
// nothing on the client. Bolts never depended on the check, so they worked.
//
// 1.3.1: aura pulses never get the bonus. The aura events set flag 20000000h
// in unit+128h for exactly the length of the aura's do-handler call (skill
// auras 437460, item auras 437230, aura start 43B680), so a hit, a proc or a
// missile of a player carrying that flag is never a crossbow one, whatever the
// player cast last. Missiles that a skill fires under a new cast id each
// (523370, the multi-missile fire used by Mirrored Blades, 52353C) now belong
// to the cast that fired them; before, they matched no tagged cast and never
// got the bonus. A crossbow cast is also tagged when its bolt is spent, the
// moment the game itself applies its globaldelay with a crossbow held. Bolt
// pools exist only for players holding a crossbow (1.3.0 gave every player
// type unit the regeneration event reaches a pool, never removed). A debug log
// (TOML debug, or "crossbowcharges debug on") writes every decision with its
// reason, and the console command shows counters for each step.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1. Which skills are crossbow skills
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   A skill is a crossbow skill for a unit when the unit is a player holding a
//   crossbow and the skill's skills.txt globaldelay evaluates above 0:
//     weapon   INVENTORY_GetLeftHandWeapon 387690 (inventory)  the attack weapon
//     type     ITEMS_CheckItemTypeId 373890 (item, itemtype)   equivalence aware
//     record   97790 (dataContext, skillId), globaldelay calc at +564 (234h),
//              localdelay calc at +568 (238h)
//     formula  3B5160 (dataContext, unit, calc, skillId, level)
//     level    33D1E0 (unit, skill, 1, 0), D2RCore ReadWideSkillLevel
//   The itemtypes rows are found by code through the DataTables service every
//   time the tables load.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 2. The cooldown gate, shared by client and server, 3404A0 (unit, skill)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   3404A0  40 53 56 57 41 54 41 57 48 83 EC 30 48 8B DA 48 8B F9
//   Returns 0 when the skill is blocked. Its per-skill part is:
//     3351B0(unit, 185)                            state 185 present
//     2F5940(unit, 185)                            its stat list
//     2F5DF0(ctx, list, 359, layer = skill id)     > 0 means blocked
//   (the layer is the skill record's first word, movzx r9d, word [rax]).
//   After that it blocks on the shared cooldown, state 121. For crossbow skills
//   the hook runs the per-skill part unchanged, skips state 121 and blocks at
//   0 bolts. Every other skill and unit goes to the native gate.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 3. Where globaldelay is applied
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   Client 215FC0 (unit, skillId, level), the whole function:
//     record; g = formula(+564); if (g > 0) 217B30(unit, g)
//             l = formula(+568); if (l > 0) 217B90(unit, l, skillId)
//   Server 436C70 (game, unit, skillId, level), same shape, ctx = [game+106h]:
//     439470(game, unit, g) and 439500(game, unit, l, skillId)
//   Server do-handler 43ACB0 has its own inline copy inside its
//   consume-resources block, gated only on the unit being a player: the byte
//   tested at 43B152 (cmp byte [rsp+0C0h],0 / je) is written at 43AD17 by
//   sete right after the unit-type call 34B9D0. There is no sequence check, so
//   the block runs on EVERY do-event, including every arrow of a sequence skill
//   like Strafe:
//     43B163  45 8B CD             mov  r9d, r13d          ; skill id
//     43B17B  E8 -> 3B5160         globaldelay
//     43B180  85 C0 7E 0E          test eax,eax / jle
//     43B184  44 8B C0 48 8B D3 48 8B CF
//     43B18D  E8 DE E2 FF FF       call 439470             ; this call
//     43B192  44 8B 86 38 02 00 00 mov  r8d, [rsi+238h]    ; localdelay next
//   For a crossbow cast the global part spends a bolt instead. 215FC0 and
//   436C70 are hooked and rebuilt with only that difference; the call at
//   43B18D is sent through a relay that adds r13d as a fourth argument.
//   Casts triggered by items reach 43ACB0 with consume-resources 0 (the proc
//   caster 589930 passes 0 at 589C93), so they never spend a bolt.
//
//   One cast, one bolt: a cast keeps the cast id it got at skill start
//   (34F430, unit+12Ch) for all of its do-events, so the server spends at most
//   one bolt per cast id. A joined client, whose client apply 215FC0 also runs
//   per do-event, predicts at most one spend per cast id of its own unit (the
//   client skill start 217650 gives each cast an id through 8D5D0).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 4. The reload clock
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   The player stat-regeneration event 42E600 (game, unit, a3, a4) re-arms
//   itself every frame through EVENT_SetEvent 48B720 at [game+170h]+1, for
//   every player, dead or alive. The hook advances that player's pool first.
//   The current bolts are written to the current-bolts stat through 2F7D10
//   (D2RCore SetWideUnitStat); D2RCore's widened stat packets carry it to the
//   owning client, and a joined client reads it back through 2F5020. On a
//   host the client side reads the server pool directly.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 5. Which hits get the damage bonus: cast ids and the missile in progress
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   Every cast has an id, unit+12Ch (34B6C0 reads it). D2RCore's
//   GenerateUnitCastId is a per-game counter at game+16Ch, so an id names one
//   cast in the whole game; SetUnitCastId writes unit+12Ch. The game uses it
//   to track where things come from:
//     skill start   34F430 (unit, skill, castId) sets the used skill and the id;
//                   the player mode starts 42D2C0 / 42DE40 pass a fresh id
//                   only when a skill starts, so walking keeps the old one
//     missiles      537A17 in the creator 5371A0: a new missile takes the id in
//                   its creation params (+68h), else its owner's current id.
//                   Hit sub-missiles get their parent's id this way (45DF50
//                   writes the parent's 34B6C0 into +68h)
//     missile hit   462E40 stamps the owner with the missile's id around the
//                   damage and on-hit effects, then restores it
//     procs         589930 generates a fresh id (call at 589C37) while the
//                   owner still carries the id of the hit that triggered it
//     auras         437460 / 437230 / 43B680 stamp the aura's own id around
//                   every pulse and set flag 20000000h in unit+128h (34E140)
//     multi-missile 523370 gives every missile its own new id when the
//                   skill's record asks for it (52353C)
//   So the plugin tags cast ids, each with the GUID of the player it belongs
//   to:
//     - at skill start (34F430 hook), when the skill is a crossbow skill
//     - when the cast spends its bolt (the do-handler relay at 43B18D and
//       436C70), unless an aura pulse is running
//     - in item event function 20 (chance to cast on attack, on striking and
//       on kill; D2RCore's handler table entry 20), when the hit that
//       triggers it is a crossbow hit: the fresh id generated at 589C37 is
//       tagged too
//   Event function 21 (chance to cast when struck, 5837F0) is left alone, so
//   those never count, whatever the player cast last.
//
//   Not every missile hit carries the owner stamp: the area callback 464610
//   (handed out by the missile function 4576B0) and the general applier 436E90
//   hand damage to SUNITDMG_ExecuteEvents with the player's current id. So the
//   plugin also keeps, per server thread, the missiles the engine is
//   resolving, innermost last:
//     4639A0  MISSILES_ServerHitResolution (game, missile, target, forced)
//     466CE0  MISSILES_ServerDoDispatcher  (game, missile)
//     462E40  missile damage               (game, missile, target, damage)
//   Each pushes its missile on entry and pops it on return; 490300 (game,
//   unit) gives a missile's owner (unit+E8h type, +ECh GUID). A hit or a proc
//   of a player is a crossbow one when no aura pulse is running for the player
//   (flag above) and:
//     - the innermost missile in progress belongs to that player and belongs
//       to a tagged cast, or
//     - no missile of that player is in progress (skill functions, stored
//       melee records, procs outside missiles) and the player's current cast
//       id is tagged for that player.
//   A missile belongs to the cast its own id names, except (the call at
//   537A17 goes through a relay that also receives the creation params, r14,
//   owner at +8h, and links the new missile by GUID):
//     - created while one of the same owner's missiles is in progress under a
//       different id (its creator left +68h empty): the parent's cast
//     - created outside any missile under a newer id than the owner's current
//       cast (523370): the owner's current cast
//     - created during an aura pulse: no cast, never a crossbow missile
//   A link holds only while the missile still carries the id it was created
//   with. The game's own cast ids are never changed; missiles.txt LastCollide
//   keys its per-target dedup on them.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 6. Where the bonus is applied
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   SUNITDMG_ExecuteEvents 44CE80 (game, attacker, defender, bMissile, damage)
//   recalculates only when bMissile is set, and every hit meets at 44CF98:
//     44CF83  85 DB                 test ebx,ebx               ; bMissile
//     44CF85  74 11                 je   44CF98
//     44CF87  4C 8B CF 4C 8B C6 49 8B D6 49 8B CF   r9 dmg, r8 def, rdx att, rcx game
//     44CF93  E8 78 0F 00 00        call 44DF10                ; CalculateTotalDamage
//     44CF98  0F B7 47 04           movzx eax, word [rdi+4]    ; every hit
//     44CF9C  A8 20                 test al,20h
//   Hits with bMissile clear were calculated before they got here (the
//   stored melee records calculate at 44B6AC). 44CF98..44CF9D becomes a call
//   to a relay plus a nop; the relay keeps every volatile register, hands
//   (r15 game, r14 attacker, rsi defender, rdi damage) to the hook, then
//   replays the two instructions, so eax and the flags are the game's own
//   when it returns. Nothing else branches to 44CF9C. After this point come
//   the damage events, leech, the life commit and the kill events, so the
//   bonus lands on the final numbers. Inside the calculation the bleed plugin
//   reads the physical damage at 44ECA5 and the poison immunity plugin builds
//   the life total at 44EC71, both before this point, so bleed sees the
//   unboosted hit and the poison rule is kept (the total is scaled as a
//   whole).
//   Scaled D2Damage fields: +18h physical, +20h fire, +24h burn, +2Ch
//   lightning, +30h magic, +34h cold, +38h poison, +134h life total, and the
//   damage of each per-source poison entry (pointer +40h, count +48h, 12-byte
//   entries, damage at +4). Crushing blow and open wounds are item events that
//   read life directly, so they are untouched.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 7. The skill buttons
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   SkillSelectButtonWidget update 2399F0 (widget) runs every frame and calls
//   the refresh 239380, which leaves:
//     +2952 side (1 left, 2 right, controller buttons are right)
//     +3080 skill id (-1 without a skill), +3084 skill owner
//     +3056 QuantityText, +1820 current tint, +2956 normal tint,
//     +3004 cooldown tint (used for classifier code 8)
//   The number is written the way the refresh writes it:
//     visible through vtable +50h, text through 0CE510(text + 136, "%d", n),
//     or text + 512 when bytes +502 and +503 of the text box are both set.
//   The shadow child is found with 856220 (parent, name) and accepted only if
//   its type descriptor chain (vtable +58h, name at +8h, parent at +10h, as
//   built by the descriptor constructor 851030) contains "ImageWidget".
//   An image widget draws the frame at +90h (layout "frame"), with its
//   opacity in the float at +94h (layout "transparency", 1.0 = solid) and its
//   colour in the RGBA float tint at +9Ch (layout "tint"), per the
//   AbstractImageWidget property table at 2470090; 858C10 / 858C50 pass all
//   three to the draw. The tint's alpha does not make an image see-through,
//   the transparency field does.
//
//   The bolts and the shadow on a host (single player or the TCP/IP host) come
//   straight from the server pool in this process, so the shadow runs on the
//   real reload time of the bolt coming back next. A joined client rebuilds
//   the reload queue from the current-bolts stat and the globaldelay of its own
//   casts.
//   The skill node comes from 33DCD0 (unit, skillId, owner), the local player
//   from 9A480(8B2D0()).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 8. Crossbow attack speed
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   UNITS_UpdateAnimRateAndVelocity 350B40 (unit) sets a unit's animation
//   rate whenever its mode or stats change. On the attack path, with rsi = the
//   unit, r12d = the animation speed ([[unit+70h]+0Ch]) and r15d = the rate
//   percent (attackrate + diminished IAS + passive bonus 213, -30 in mode 18,
//   clamped 15..175, 250 shapeshifted):
//     351482  41 8B CF B8 1F 85 EB 51 41 0F AF CC F7 E1 8B FA C1 EF 05
//             edi = rate% * AnimSpeed / 100
//     351597  BB FF 7F 00 00       mov ebx, 7FFFh        ; every path lands here
//     35159C  3B FB 0F 86 ...      cmp edi, ebx / jbe -> store at [unit+54h]
//   The wereform rescale in between (35149E..351596) also leaves its result
//   in edi and never writes rsi. The five-byte mov at 351597 becomes a call
//   to a relay that hands (unit, edi) to HookedAttackRate, takes the new rate
//   back into edi, redoes the mov and returns.
//   A frame of animation costs 256, so an attack of FramesPerDirection frames
//   ([[unit+70h]+8]) takes ceil(256 * FPD / rate) - 1 frames, the formula that
//   reproduces the published IAS tables. For the crossbow attack animation
//   (A1 = mode 7, mode at [unit+0Ch]) the rate becomes
//   ceil(256 * FPD / (N + 1)), which gives exactly N frames, with
//   N = default_attack_frames + the attack frames stat. The same function
//   runs on the server (timing) and on every client (animation), so both agree.
//   Everything else keeps the game's own speed: other sequence skills (mode
//   18), A2 (only the Assassin has an A2 crossbow animation) and the special
//   animations S1..S4, which skills such as Assassin traps use.
//   whirlwind-follow-cursor byte-checks 350B40's entry and faster-cast-rate-cap
//   patches the cast branch at 350C29; neither touches 351482..3515A3.
//
//   Mirrored Blades (skills.txt seqnum 25) is a sequence: the player stays in
//   mode 18 (SQ) and plays steps of another animation from a table compiled
//   into the exe (resolver 3CB890, table 2386650). Its crossbow slot (6) and
//   bow slot (5) share 18 steps of the cast animation (mode 10, frames 0..17,
//   hit event on step 12). Its speed comes through 351597 like A1: mode 18's
//   rate entry at 1D00518 sends skills with skills.txt UseAttackRate (record
//   byte +26h, bit 8h, tested at 351142) to the attack path, and a seqtrans
//   other than SC (record +32h, tested at 350CFB) keeps it off the cast path.
//     length   the installer 34D900 writes steps << 8 to unit+48h (3CB830) and
//              the countdown to unit+64h (3CB870 << 8); the mode start 34C880
//              calls it right before 350B40. Sequence 25's slots have equal
//              step counts, so both hold 18 << 8 with a crossbow.
//     advance  3476F1..347766 adds the rate at unit+54h to the position,
//              subtracts it from the countdown and flags the end (unit+128h
//              bit 1Bh) once the countdown reaches 0. A sequence therefore
//              lasts ceil(length / rate) frames, one frame more than a plain
//              animation with the same numbers.
//     skill    the used skill is [[unit+100h]+18h] (34BA40 -> 33E090), its id
//              the record's first word (33E080), as 350B40 reads it.
//   With that skill id equal to mirrored_blades_skill_id, the sequence
//   installed (unit+40h) and a crossbow held, the rate becomes
//   ceil(length / N): exactly N frames for the whole Mirrored Blades attack.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Nothing calls into the game while the plugin loads
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   The UI type descriptors are built lazily, once, the first time their
//   getter runs. The ImageWidget getter 8599F0 looks its base type up by name
//   at that moment (853090("AbstractImageWidget")) and keeps whatever it got;
//   if the base is not registered yet it only asserts "Check the registration
//   order?" and builds ImageWidget with no parent. 1.0.0 called that getter at
//   plugin load, before the game had registered its widget types, so every
//   ImageWidget lost the Widget and AbstractImageWidget fields (rect, tint,
//   visibility and the rest) and the whole UI broke. Load now only checks
//   bytes and uses loader services; the type check reads descriptor names.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Other plugins
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   No site here is touched by any plugin or static patch in the ESR set:
//   srcdam-calc-field hooks 43ACB0's entry, cast-on-cast patches 43AF06 to
//   43AF25, 43B0EC and 589C6F, soft-hits patches event slots 4 and 6, bleed
//   redirects 44ECA5, poison immunity patches inside 44EC71 to 44ECA4,
//   charge-aoe-hits hooks the entries of 5622C0 and 44B600, engine-stability
//   hooks 537B23 inside the missile creator and works inside the SrvHit
//   function 45FB50, critical-strike-damage works inside 44C030 and 465420.
//   whirlwind-follow-cursor calls 34F430 directly and reaches this hook.
